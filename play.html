 <h3>ACT I _The Market Place of Padua at noon_; _in the background is the great
    Cathedral of Padua_; _the architecture is Romanesque_, _and wrought in
    black and white marbles_; _a flight of marble steps leads up to the
    Cathedral door_; _at the foot of the steps are two large stone lions_;
    _the houses on each aide of the stage have coloured awnings from their
    windows_, _and are flanked by stone arcades_; _on the right of the stage
    is the public fountain_, _with a triton in green bronze blowing from a
    conch_; _around the fountain is a stone seat_; _the bell of the Cathedral
    is ringing_, _and the citizens_, _men_, _women and children_, _are
    passing into the Cathedral_.</h3>

       <P class="speech"> I think it must be here.  [_Goes up to passer-by and doffs his cap_.]
        Pray, sir, is this the market place, and that the church of Santa
        Croce? <p class="stage_directions"> [_Citizen bows_.]</p> <P class="speech">  I thank you, sir.</P>

       <p class="speech"> Ay! it is here.</p>
     
     <h4 class="name ASCANIO">ASCANIO</h4>
     
        <p class="speech">I would it were somewhere else, for I see no wine-shop.</p>

        <p class="stage_directions">[_Taking a letter from his pocket and reading it_.]</p>  <p class="speech"> ‘The hour noon;
        the city, Padua; the place, the market; and the day, Saint Philip’s
        Day.’</p>

        <p class="speech">And what of the man, how shall we know him?</p>
     
     <h4 class="name GUIDO" >GUIDO</h4>
     
        <p class="speech">‘I will wear a violet cloak with a silver falcon broidered on the
        shoulder.’  A brave attire, Ascanio.</p>

        <p class="speech">I’d sooner have my leathern jerkin.  And you think he will tell you of
        your father?</p>
     
    <h4 class="name GUIDO" > GUIDO</h4>
     
        <p class="speech">Why, yes!  It is a month ago now, you remember; I was in the vineyard,
        just at the corner nearest the road, where the goats used to get in, a
        man rode up and asked me was my name Guido, and gave me this letter,
        signed ‘Your Father’s Friend,’ bidding me be here to-day if I would
        know the secret of my birth, and telling me how to recognise the
        writer!  I had always thought old Pedro was my uncle, but he told me
        that he was not, but that I had been left a child in his charge by
        some one he had never since seen.</p>

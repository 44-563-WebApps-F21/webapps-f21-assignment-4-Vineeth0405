 <h2>The Market Place of Padua</h2>
<h3>ACT I _The Market Place of Padua at noon_; _in the background is the great
    Cathedral of Padua_; _the architecture is Romanesque_, _and wrought in
    black and white marbles_; _a flight of marble steps leads up to the
    Cathedral door_; _at the foot of the steps are two large stone lions_;
    _the houses on each aide of the stage have coloured awnings from their
    windows_, _and are flanked by stone arcades_; _on the right of the stage
    is the public fountain_, _with a triton in green bronze blowing from a
    conch_; _around the fountain is a stone seat_; _the bell of the Cathedral
    is ringing_, _and the citizens_, _men_, _women and children_, _are
    passing into the Cathedral_.</h3>
